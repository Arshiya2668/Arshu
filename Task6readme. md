🧠 Task 6 – K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier

🎯 Objective:

To implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm using the Iris dataset, and classify flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (sklearn)

Google Colab

📂 Dataset:

Name: Iris.csv

Source: sklearn.datasets.load_iris()

Target: Predict the flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

🔍 Features in Dataset:

Feature	Description

sepal length (cm)	Length of the sepal
sepal width (cm)	Width of the sepal
petal length (cm)	Length of the petal
petal width (cm)	Width of the petal
species	Type of flower (target variable)

⚙️ Steps Performed:

1. Loaded the Iris dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_iris()


2. Converted the data into a Pandas DataFrame


3. Created a CSV file from the dataset


4. Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y)


5. Split the data into training and testing sets


6. Applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification


7. Made predictions on test data


8. Evaluated performance using:

Confusion Matrix

Accuracy Score

9. Visualized predictions using a scatter plot

✅ Output:
