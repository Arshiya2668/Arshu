# 🤖 Task 4 – Logistic Regression (Binary Classification)

## 🎯 Objective:
To build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a tumor is **malignant** or **benign** using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

---

## 📂 Dataset Description:
The dataset contains medical features like:
- `radius_mean`, `texture_mean`, `perimeter_mean`  
and a target label:
- `diagnosis` → M (Malignant = 1), B (Benign = 0)

---

## 🔢 Steps Followed:
1. Created or uploaded the dataset (`data.csv`)
2. Cleaned the data:
   - Removed ID column
   - Encoded labels (M = 1, B = 0)
3. Split dataset into training & testing sets
4. Scaled features using `StandardScaler`
5. Trained Logistic Regression model
6. Evaluated using:
   - ✅ Confusion Matrix
   - ✅ Classification Report
   - ✅ ROC-AUC Score
7. Plotted ROC Curve

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation:
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score printed
- ROC Curve plotted
- AUC Score calculated

---

## 📁 Files Included:
- `data.csv` – Breast Cancer dataset  
- `task4_logistic_regression.ipynb` – Colab notebook  
- `README.md` – Project summary
