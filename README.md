# 🧠 Task 3 – Linear Regression (AI & ML Internship)

## 🎯 Objective:
To implement and understand Simple & Multiple Linear Regression using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Google Colab

---

## 📂 Dataset Description:
I manually created a dataset with 5 entries containing:
- `area` - House area in sq.ft
- `bedrooms` - Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms` - Number of bathrooms
- `stories` - Number of floors
- `price` - House price (target variable)

---

## 🔢 Steps Performed:
1. Created sample dataset using Python dictionary
2. Converted it to DataFrame and saved as CSV
3. Loaded the CSV into Colab
4. Defined Features (X) and Target (y)
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Trained a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
7. Predicted house prices on test data
8. Evaluated the model using:
   - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
   - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
   - R² Score
9. Printed model coefficients & intercept

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation:
- **MAE**: 0.0  
- **MSE**: 0.0  
- **R² Score**: 1.0  
*(Since we used a small and clean dataset)*
