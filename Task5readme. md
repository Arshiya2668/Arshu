🩺 Heart Disease Prediction using Decision Tree & Random Forest

This project is part of Task 5 from my internship, where I implemented two powerful machine learning models — **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** — to predict the presence of heart disease based on patient data.


📁 Dataset

- Dataset Name: `heart.csv`  
- Source: [Kaggle - Heart Disease UCI](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)



🧠 Models Used

1. **Decision Tree Classifier**  
2. **Random Forest Classifier**

---
 🔍 Features in Dataset

- `age` – Age of the patient  
- `sex` – Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)  
- `cp` – Chest pain type  
- `trestbps` – Resting blood pressure  
- `chol` – Cholesterol level  
- `fbs` – Fasting blood sugar  
- `restecg` – Resting ECG result  
- `thalach` – Max heart rate  
- `exang` – Exercise-induced angina  
- `oldpeak` – ST depression  
- `slope`, `ca`, `thal` – Other ECG-related attributes  
- `target` – 1 (disease) or 0 (no disease)


⚙️ Steps Performed

1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Preprocessed and split the data  
3. Trained a Decision Tree model  
4. Visualized the decision tree  
5. Evaluated the model (accuracy, confusion matrix, report)  
6. Trained a Random Forest model  
7. Compared accuracy and feature importance  
8. Made predictions on new patient data


 📊 Results

- Both models performed well on the dataset  
- Random Forest gave more stable and robust results  
- Top features: `cp`, `chol`, `age`, `oldpeak`


 ✅ Technologies Used

- Python  
- pandas, matplotlib  
- scikit-learn (`DecisionTreeClassifier`, `RandomForestClassifier`)
