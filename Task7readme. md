🧠 Task 8 – SVM Classifier (Support Vector Machine)


---

🎯 Objective:

To build a binary classification model using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with:

Both Linear and RBF kernels

Visualization of decision boundaries

Hyperparameter tuning (C and gamma)

Evaluation using cross-validation



---

🛠️ Tools Used:

Python

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

NumPy, Pandas

mlxtend (for decision boundary plots)

Google Colab



---

📊 Dataset Details:

Created using make_classification()

2 informative features

100 samples

Suitable for binary classification and 2D visualization



---

🚀 Workflow:

1. Generated synthetic binary classification dataset


2. Split dataset into train/test sets


3. Trained SVM model with:

🔹 Linear kernel

🔹 RBF kernel



4. Visualized decision boundaries (2D plots)


5. Tuned hyperparameters C and gamma for RBF


6. Evaluated model performance using:

🎯 Accuracy Score

📊 Confusion Matrix

🔁 5-fold Cross-Validation





---

✅ Output Highlights:

📈 Accuracy of both kernels printed

📊 Confusion matrices for model predictions

🌈 Decision boundary plots

🔍 Best accuracy with tuned hyperparameters

📋 Average cross-validation score



---

💡 What I Learned:

Working of linear vs. non-linear SVMs

Impact of hyperparameters (C, gamma)

How to visualize decision boundaries in 2D

How to use cross_val_score() for stable evaluation
